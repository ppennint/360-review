My soon to be in-laws and SO came here to give it a try, since they are the cheaper alternative to other Thai places. We ordered one of every appetizer and were blown away by the flavors. After eating all of that we obviously had to get a main dish as well (don't judge, we get hungry). I ordered the See Yew and fell in love, so did everyone that ordered the Street Noodle (1&2). Along with the food, you can't beat the fact that there isn't a corkage fee, only a .50 recycling fee. Highly recommended", "reviewer8", 1/7/2016, 5);

A friend originally told me about this place and it took me a few months to try it. I have been back three times since then! The vibe is cool and open. You can sit down or order take out. I usually get the Street Noodle #2 or See Yew with shrimp both at spice levels of 2. You can bring your own drinks but they will charge you fifty cents for a recycling fee. Also, Noodlehead is cash only but that doesn't stop people from eating here. The soup is excellent. I'm determined to try the entire menu, because I am convinced that everything on the menu is delicious. They are very busy on evenings and weekends so get there early!", "reviewer10", 5/16/2017, 4);

Be warned that this place fills up fast and some tables are very close to the kitchen. Rather than sit so close we opted for take out (be warned they don't have phones so you have to in person put in your order). They are happy to substitute any meat noodle with tofu (just watch out for the type of broth). We loved the Chiang Mai curry noodle with tofu and Mr. Jessica ordered the see yew with shrimp. We order 1/5 spicy to get a bit of spice and flavor but not to be overwhelmed. Their service was blistering fast on a packed night. We waited less than 10 mins between ordering and walking out the door with our fresh hot food. They are consistent and fast and a good noodle fix." , "reviewer11", 2/6/2016, 3);

The restaurant had a very nice cute setting and was BYOB which I love! We decided to try the pork belly buns and we were not disappointed. Even better with a little siracha on them.

Despite being crowded we got a table rather quickly and the staff was super friendly. It's BYOB so my friend and I brought a 6 pack and there is only a .50 recycling fee no corkage charge. We got the pork belly steamed buns first and they were unbelievable! We only got 1 serving which comes with 2 dumplings but next time I have to get my own!! I had Street Noodles #1 and my friend had See Yew and both were amazing. The food comes quickly and it's very nice sized portions. This restaurant is CASH ONLY, important to remember that, as I am someone who typically never has cash and uses my card. I will definitely be going back to Noodlehead soon and I highly recommend checking it out if you haven't yet!", "reviewer13", 12/30/2016, 5);

I still love wide noodles the best, so I ordered Kee Mao, with less salt. Wide noodles had a perfect sweet and salty flavor, and I really liked the cooked basil. My friends ordered See Yew (another wide noodle dish, one I ordered last time), and the Chiang Mai Curry. I tried the curry, and I think I'll come back and get that too. The curry was thick and came with fried egg noodles. I wouldn't order the dumplings again though, those were disappointing in taste and size. BYOB, at 50 cents a person, confirmed. Cash only--don't forget.", "reviewer13", 6/22/2015, 5);

(It makes me wish that they had peking duck buns too...but this place is Thai and that's a Chinese thing.) For the main dish, I ordered See Yew, no spiciness (true to scale). It was a little salty, but the wide noodles were so good, I'd order it again and just ask for less salt. I tried my friend's street noodles #2 with the tempura shrimp, and it was SO GOOD. I appreciate that they used real shrimp. There are way too many places around that use those tiny frozen shrimps, but NOT HERE! :D Also I heard it's BYOB and 50 cents a person.

Not only that, it was the first restaurant that hubby and I hit up after moving to the 'Burgh. This most recent visit was not as eventful, but it sure was tasty!! I usually tend to go for the Pad Thai, but this time I went for the See Yew. This dish had egg, broccoli, chicken, big ol' rice noodles all on some tasty black sweet soy sauce. Boy, let me tell ya this was delightful!! I had a taste of the Chiang Mai Curry, which was good, but a little too spicy for my taste. Either way you can't go wrong with this place. The price is right, the decor on point, and the service was outstanding. The servers had great suggestions which helped me a fair bit since I don't like spicy food. Overall great experience and would come back again!", "reviewer17", 5/27/2015, 5);

The pig wings were pretty good, but could have been a little more tender. For 6.50 you only get three small pork ribs, probably won't end up getting it again. The curry was good and so good with the crispy noodles layered on top. The See Yew is also good, very traditional and would try again. The kitchen staff look like Thai so that's a good sign for Thai food. They don't accept credit cards and I never carry cash but luckily I had enough to cover the bill so BRING CASH. Service is excellent, low light ambience setting, clean, and modern. Price is very fair. Popular among the college scene and busy as well. I definitely will come back to try their other dishes.

Parking was a breeze to get - thanks to Pittsburgh, we were able to get a spot directly across from the restaurant (and it was free parking after 6)! Being from Philly, that's pretty incredible on a Friday night. We were seated almost immediately outside, and were given waters along with the menu. The food selection was great, even for vegetarians like us - we ordered the Kee Mao and See Yew with tofu instead of other proteins. The Kee Mao had a 3 level of spice, which I found to be a perfect amount of heat. They have a bottle of Sriracha at the table if you'd like to be more brave. I didn't try the See Yew but heard that it was delicious as well. The portion sizes were also great, just enough to feel satiated but not so much to over-stuff. Pricing was also great - only $9 per dish! Service was very friendly and sociable (almost seemed like the waiter was just a casual friend on the street who came up and asked for our order! We got our food quickly and were given our change back promptly as well. Every other review says this, too, but cash only. All in all, a huge thumbs up and I would definitely come back here soon!.", "reviewer19", 5/9/2015, 5);
INSERT INTO reviews (business_owner_id, source, content, username, date, rating) VALUES (1, "Yelp", "I eat here fairly often, because I enjoy spicy Thai noodles, and I almost always order the See Yew with tofu, which is delicious. What I feel sets this place apart is that I can freely ask for "no fish sauce" (since I am a vegetarian), and they happily accommodate. I understand that there are probably more authentic Thai places out there, but not all of them are so understanding of my desire not to consume fish products. I also like that it's BYOB, and I don't mind the cash-only rule. Every time I've gone, they've been super chill about splitting the bill. A couple downsides (that keep it from getting 5 stars): 1. They don't allow for call-aheads or reservations and it can get pretty busy. I hate waiting (sometimes the wait is over an hour) so I only eat here for a late lunch (like 2ish). 2. The spice level is somewhat inconsistent. I tried every spice level up to 4 before finally deciding on 3. Some days that 3 tastes more like a 2, and others more like a 4 or 4.5! Just a heads up so you don't accidentally order something too spicy to eat.", "reviewer20", 7/3/2015, 4);
